Part 6

The thinking then of the simple objects of thought is found in those cases where falsehood is impossible: where the alternative of true or false applies, there we always find a putting together of objects of thought in a quasi-unity.
As Empedocles said that 'where heads of many a creature sprouted without necks' they afterwards by Love's power were combined, so here too objects of thought which were given separate are combined, e.
g.
'incommensurate' and 'diagonal': if the combination be of objects past or future the combination of thought includes in its content the date.
For falsehood always involves a synthesis; for even if you assert that what is white is not white you have included not white in a synthesis.
It is possible also to call all these cases division as well as combination.
However that may be, there is not only the true or false assertion that Cleon is white but also the true or false assertion that he was or will he white.
In each and every case that which unifies is mind.

Since the word 'simple' has two senses, i.
e.
may mean either (a) 'not capable of being divided' or (b) 'not actually divided', there is nothing to prevent mind from knowing what is undivided, e.
g.
when it apprehends a length (which is actually undivided) and that in an undivided time; for the time is divided or undivided in the same manner as the line.
It is not possible, then, to tell what part of the line it was apprehending in each half of the time: the object has no actual parts until it has been divided: if in thought you think each half separately, then by the same act you divide the time also, the half-lines becoming as it were new wholes of length.
But if you think it as a whole consisting of these two possible parts, then also you think it in a time which corresponds to both parts together.
(But what is not quantitatively but qualitatively simple is thought in a simple time and by a simple act of the soul.
)

But that which mind thinks and the time in which it thinks are in this case divisible only incidentally and not as such.
For in them too there is something indivisible (though, it may be, not isolable) which gives unity to the time and the whole of length; and this is found equally in every continuum whether temporal or spatial.

Points and similar instances of things that divide, themselves being indivisible, are realized in consciousness in the same manner as privations.

A similar account may be given of all other cases, e.
g.
how evil or black is cognized; they are cognized, in a sense, by means of their contraries.
That which cognizes must have an element of potentiality in its being, and one of the contraries must be in it.
But if there is anything that has no contrary, then it knows itself and is actually and possesses independent existence.

Assertion is the saying of something concerning something, e.
g.
affirmation, and is in every case either true or false: this is not always the case with mind: the thinking of the definition in the sense of the constitutive essence is never in error nor is it the assertion of something concerning something, but, just as while the seeing of the special object of sight can never be in error, the belief that the white object seen is a man may be mistaken, so too in the case of objects which are without matter.
