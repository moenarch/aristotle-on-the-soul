Part 12

The nutritive soul then must be possessed by everything that is alive, and every such thing is endowed with soul from its birth to its death.
For what has been born must grow, reach maturity, and decay-all of which are impossible without nutrition.
Therefore the nutritive faculty must be found in everything that grows and decays.

But sensation need not be found in all things that live.
For it is impossible for touch to belong either (1) to those whose body is uncompounded or (2) to those which are incapable of taking in the forms without their matter.

But animals must be endowed with sensation, since Nature does nothing in vain.
For all things that exist by Nature are means to an end, or will be concomitants of means to an end.
Every body capable of forward movement would, if unendowed with sensation, perish and fail to reach its end, which is the aim of Nature; for how could it obtain nutriment? Stationary living things, it is true, have as their nutriment that from which they have arisen; but it is not possible that a body which is not stationary but produced by generation should have a soul and a discerning mind without also having sensation.
(Nor yet even if it were not produced by generation.
Why should it not have sensation? Because it were better so either for the body or for the soul? But clearly it would not be better for either: the absence of sensation will not enable the one to think better or the other to exist better.
) Therefore no body which is not stationary has soul without sensation.

But if a body has sensation, it must be either simple or compound.
And simple it cannot be; for then it could not have touch, which is indispensable.
This is clear from what follows.
An animal is a body with soul in it: every body is tangible, i.
e.
perceptible by touch; hence necessarily, if an animal is to survive, its body must have tactual sensation.
All the other senses, e.
g.
smell, sight, hearing, apprehend through media; but where there is immediate contact the animal, if it has no sensation, will be unable to avoid some things and take others, and so will find it impossible to survive.
That is why taste also is a sort of touch; it is relative to nutriment, which is just tangible body; whereas sound, colour, and odour are innutritious, and further neither grow nor decay.
Hence it is that taste also must be a sort of touch, because it is the sense for what is tangible and nutritious.

Both these senses, then, are indispensable to the animal, and it is clear that without touch it is impossible for an animal to be.
All the other senses subserve well-being and for that very reason belong not to any and every kind of animal, but only to some, e.
g.
those capable of forward movement must have them; for, if they are to survive, they must perceive not only by immediate contact but also at a distance from the object.
This will be possible if they can perceive through a medium, the medium being affected and moved by the perceptible object, and the animal by the medium.
just as that which produces local movement causes a change extending to a certain point, and that which gave an impulse causes another to produce a new impulse so that the movement traverses a medium the first mover impelling without being impelled, the last moved being impelled without impelling, while the medium (or media, for there are many) is both-so is it also in the case of alteration, except that the agent produces produces it without the patient's changing its place.
Thus if an object is dipped into wax, the movement goes on until submersion has taken place, and in stone it goes no distance at all, while in water the disturbance goes far beyond the object dipped: in air the disturbance is propagated farthest of all, the air acting and being acted upon, so long as it maintains an unbroken unity.
That is why in the case of reflection it is better, instead of saying that the sight issues from the eye and is reflected, to say that the air, so long as it remains one, is affected by the shape and colour.
On a smooth surface the air possesses unity; hence it is that it in turn sets the sight in motion, just as if the impression on the wax were transmitted as far as the wax extends.
