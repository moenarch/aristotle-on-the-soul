Part 11

We must consider also in the case of imperfect animals, sc.
those which have no sense but touch, what it is that in them originates movement.
Can they have imagination or not? or desire? Clearly they have feelings of pleasure and pain, and if they have these they must have desire.
But how can they have imagination? Must not we say that, as their movements are indefinite, they have imagination and desire, but indefinitely?

Sensitive imagination, as we have said, is found in all animals, deliberative imagination only in those that are calculative: for whether this or that shall be enacted is already a task requiring calculation; and there must be a single standard to measure by, for that is pursued which is greater.
It follows that what acts in this way must be able to make a unity out of several images.

This is the reason why imagination is held not to involve opinion, in that it does not involve opinion based on inference, though opinion involves imagination.
Hence appetite contains no deliberative element.
Sometimes it overpowers wish and sets it in movement: at times wish acts thus upon appetite, like one sphere imparting its movement to another, or appetite acts thus upon appetite, i.
e.
in the condition of moral weakness (though by nature the higher faculty is always more authoritative and gives rise to movement).
Thus three modes of movement are possible.

The faculty of knowing is never moved but remains at rest.
Since the one premiss or judgement is universal and the other deals with the particular (for the first tells us that such and such a kind of man should do such and such a kind of act, and the second that this is an act of the kind meant, and I a person of the type intended), it is the latter opinion that really originates movement, not the universal; or rather it is both, but the one does so while it remains in a state more like rest, while the other partakes in movement.
